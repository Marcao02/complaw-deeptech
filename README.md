# Computational Contracts

> What I'd like to see is legal contracts written up in a kind of code
similar to computer code; something that can be checked for validity,
evaluated, perhaps even unit tested. We could perhaps generate natural
language descriptions of the code in varying complexity (maybe even
generate legalese, which could be useful if you're using the code to
create custom contracts), or it could be accurately visualized in some
way. My fear is that in writing such code to deal with real-world
issues, you'd also need a *model* of the real world, and that would be
incredibly hard to define.

**As you can probably tell, this repo is undergoing a major reorganization. This is so it will be easier for you to understand and contribute to.**
