# Quickstart

In addition to the GF_LIB_PATH that you have surely already set up by now,

```
export GF_GRAMMAR_PATH=../201705-may/gruter
```

or whatever is correct in your case.

# INSTALL

You should just edit your `.zshenv` to have a `GF_GRAMMAR_PATH` line next to your `GF_LIB_PATH` as a fully qualified path.
