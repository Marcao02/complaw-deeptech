OBSERVATION - Does it even make sense to start axiomatizing before having a big list of test cases (hypothetical violations and non-violations)?


`Arbitration` - Arbitration is by any L4-certified arbiter agreed upon by both parties, or if both parties cannot agree, then chosen by Legalese.

`Assignment of Agreement` - To what extent does this agreement survive changes to the parties, e.g. in a merger or acquisition situation?

`Confidentiality of Relationship`
The right to signal any of the following facts:
- That the parties have signed an NDA
- That the parties are talking to each other
- That the parties are contemplating a transaction

`Definition of Protected Information`
I would call this the definition of possibly-protected information, since the actual protected information will be a subset of it.

Then there are various exclusions which define that subset.
