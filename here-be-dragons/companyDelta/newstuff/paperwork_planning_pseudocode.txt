# Paperwork planning for V2 requirements

Because Dustin isn't clear enough on them to be able to decide on the appropriate model for the problem.

This should not contain any implementation ideas. Vague language only.

We have a notion of `CompanyState`, which is our model for a certain portion of the V2 app state for a particular company's financing. Exactly what will go in that model has not been completely determined.

My understanding is that it should include:

	-all the details of the signed agreements
	-all the details of the paperwork that has been submitted to the regulator
	-all the details of the paperwork that is held privately
	-various infrequently-changing details (name, identification number, which of the regulators "person" classes do they belong to) of everyone who is currently involved in the financing. Let us call these people the `InterestedParties`.
	-various temporary details about the `InterestedParties`, including: Have we told the regulator about them?
	-all the details of the paperwork that is out for signing, but unsigned.
	-any responses from the government that we are waiting for (is this a thing???)
	-all the details of which `InterestedParties` hold which securities

A `Plan` (paperwork/action plan) should be useful to the user. At the very least, from it they can easily deduce the set of actions `a` such

	-they can do `a` now, AND
	-they must do `a` eventually

*Parallel tasks*: Consider the situation where 5 actions a1,...,a5 are doable from `CompanyState` c1, and doing any of them ai makes ai no longer doable and leaves the others to-be-done. Let c2 be the CompanyState where all 5 actions have been.
Modeling a plan in that scenario in the most straight-forward, single-path way uses at least 5! nodes, which would obfuscate the visualization of the plan. We thus should provide a means of representing this situation more concisely.







The output of our code should be a directed graph of Actions, CompanyStates, and various dependencies (this is intentionally vague at the moment).



Example:
	A user for the Company has added two investors with existing shares. The ShareHolders agreement now needs to be



Our paperwork plans are fundamentally partially ordered. Thus, a plan is a DAG.
