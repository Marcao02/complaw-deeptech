According to the L4 semantics defined in `L4-LSM-Formal-Semantics-LaTeX`, at most one *strong obligation* (declared with the `must` keyword) can be *active* in any contract state. In contrast, there may be many *weak obligations* (currently declared with the `obligations-options-include` keyword as of this writing, but likely to change) active in a given contract state. Once this property has been verified, any instance (and thus all instances) of `must` can be replaced with `obligations-options-include` without changing the semantics of the contract. This is because the semantics of a unique active weak obligation are idential to the semantics of a (necessarily unique) strong obligation.
