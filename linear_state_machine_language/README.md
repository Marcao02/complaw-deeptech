# L4 Linear State Machine (LSM) Language

Read the (out-of-date) [LSM Tutorial](https://github.com/legalese/legalese-compiler/blob/master/linear_state_machine_language/docs-out-of-date/out-of-date_LSM_tutorial.md) first.

[Definition of L4's computational model](https://github.com/legalese/legalese-compiler/blob/master/linear_state_machine_language/L4-LSM-Formal-Semantics-LaTeX/L4-LSM-semantics.pdf)

Many of the [example contracts](https://github.com/legalese/legalese-compiler/tree/master/linear_state_machine_language/pyL4/examples) are problems from Tom Hvitved's PhD thesis. He wrote executable contracts in the language CSL that he developed. CSL was the greatest influence on L4/LSM among formal contract languages, but in the end they use quite different approaches.

See [pyL4/README.md](https://github.com/legalese/legalese-compiler/tree/master/linear_state_machine_language/pyL4/README.md) for info specifically about the implementation of L4 in python (which currently the only implementation).

In particular note the [mini-docs](https://github.com/legalese/legalese-compiler/tree/master/linear_state_machine_language/pyL4/docs).
