# L4 Linear State Machine (LSM) Language


[Definition of L4's computational model](https://github.com/legalese/complaw-deeptech/blob/master/linear_state_machine_language/pyL4/docs/LegaleseResearchReportApril2018/LegaleseResearchReportApril2018.pdf)

Many of the [example contracts](https://github.com/legalese/complaw-deeptech/tree/master/linear_state_machine_language/pyL4/examples) are problems from Tom Hvitved's PhD thesis. He wrote executable contracts in the language CSL that he developed. CSL was the greatest influence on our work among formal contract languages, but in the end they use quite different approaches.

See [pyL4/README.md](https://github.com/legalese/complaw-deeptech/tree/master/linear_state_machine_language/pyL4/README.md) for info specifically about the implementation of L4 in python (which currently is the only implementation). There are a very few [mini-docs](https://github.com/legalese/complaw-deeptech/tree/master/linear_state_machine_language/pyL4/docs).
