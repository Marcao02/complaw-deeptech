# L4 Linear State Machine (LSM) Language


## Dependencies
You'll need to install Python 3.6 because the code uses format strings e.g. `f"text {code} text"`. 

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-362/

Also, Python 3 is needed to recognize the static typing annotations. It will be installed alongside any other python versions you have, so don't worry about it breaking anything.

### For generating diagrams
Install graphviz (AKA 'dot'):
